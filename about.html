    <center><h1>About Farming School</h1></center>
    
    <h2><u>Our Mission</u></h2>
    <p><b>Farm to School</b> is dedicated to enriching the connection communities have with fresh, healthy food and local producers by transforming school food systems and supporting experiential education. Our mission is to improve the health of children and communities while providing new market opportunities for farmers. Through collaboration with schools, local farmers, and community members, we aim to foster an environment where children can learn about and appreciate the value of nutritious, locally-sourced food.</p>

    <h2><u>Our Vision</u></h2>
    <p>We envision a future where every student has access to fresh, locally-produced foods and is educated about the benefits of healthy eating and sustainable agriculture. By integrating locally-grown food into school cafeterias and curricula, we aspire to cultivate a generation of students who understand and value the connections between food, health, community, and the environment. Our ultimate goal is to contribute to the creation of resilient, sustainable local food systems and healthier communities.</p>

    <h2><u>Achievements</u></h2>
    <p><b>National Reach:</b> Farm to School programs are now active in all 50 states, Washington D.C., Native Communities, and U.S. Territories, thanks to the efforts of the National Farm to School Network (NFSN).</p>
    <p><b>Policy Influence:</b> Successfully influenced policy through the 2010 Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act and the 2015 Farm to School Act, which expanded the scope and support for farm to school programs nationwide.</p>
    <p><b>Local Economic Impact:</b> Each dollar invested in farm to school programs stimulates an additional $0.60-$2.16 of local economic activity, supporting small farmers and local economies.</p>
    <p><b>Educational Impact:</b> Numerous schools have reported increased participation in school meal programs, improved nutrition, and higher consumption of fruits and vegetables among students.</p>
    <p><b>Innovative Programs:</b> Initiatives like the Farm Fresh Start in Hartford, Connecticut, Farmers Market Salad Bar in Santa Monica, California, and the New North Florida Marketing Cooperative have set successful examples of integrating farm to school practices.</p>
    <p><b>Environmental Stewardship:</b> Promoted sustainable agricultural practices that reduce environmental impact through local sourcing, reducing food miles, and fostering community-supported agriculture.</p>
    <p><b>Research and Evaluation:</b> Conducted and supported research that highlights the positive impacts of farm to school programs on student health, academic performance, and community well-being.</p>

    <h2><u>Our Programs</u></h2>
    <p><b>Local Food Sourcing:</b> Partnering with local farmers to supply schools with fresh, nutritious produce, dairy, meat, and more.</p>
    <p><b>School Gardens:</b> Creating hands-on learning opportunities through school gardens where students can grow and harvest their own food.</p>
    <p><b>Nutrition Education:</b> Integrating food and nutrition education into school curricula, teaching students about the benefits of healthy eating and sustainable agriculture.</p>
    <p><b>Farm Visits:</b> Organizing farm visits to give students firsthand experience of local agriculture and where their food comes from.</p>
    <p><b>Recycling Programs:</b> Implementing recycling and composting programs to teach students about waste reduction and sustainability.</p>
